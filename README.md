# First Check GPU (2019.05.16)

This is so simple code (especially this is not a coded) you can search in tensorflow documentation but, it if useful to me(because of check)

# Second Data Argumentation (2019.05.24)

The Data Argumentation code. It is simple, but contains some annoying things to re-implement.
The data maps a small image to a 1920 * 1080 zero map, mapping it in the upper left upper right, lower right and lower right four directions. After that, each data is expanded and stored in 6 ways such as Gaussian Noise, Rotation and Flipping.

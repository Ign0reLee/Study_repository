For useful to me, to study


# First Check GPU (2019.05.16)

This is so simple code (especially this is not a coded) you can search in tensorflow documentation but, it if useful to me(because of check)

# Second Data Argumentation (2019.05.24)

The Data Argumentation code. It is simple, but contains some annoying things to re-implement.
The data maps a small image to a 1920 * 1080 zero map, mapping it in the upper left upper right, lower right and lower right four directions. After that, each data is expanded and stored in 6 ways such as Gaussian Noise, Rotation and Flipping.


# Third Data Argumentation (2019. 05. 27)

New Data Argumentation code registered! this code image cropping random, and checked overlapped or not with ground truth and save cropped image as it's label

# Preprocessing for Object Detection API (2019.06.20)

For my studying, code writed for very easy to read

# Class TF (2019.06.25)

Study using class in my tensorflow code

# Studying All ways to make batch_normalization in tensorflow(2019. 07. 25)

Want to make style transfer but very many way to make it so i testing all about it
